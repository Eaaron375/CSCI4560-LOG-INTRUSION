# CSCI4560-LOG-INTRUSION
This project demonstrates how database systems can be applied to cybersecurity intrusion detection. We collect and store security log data in MySQL, then analyze it with SQL queries and Python scripts to detect anomalies such as:
	•	Multiple failed login attempts in a short time
	•	Logins from unusual IP addresses
	•	Suspicious activity outside normal working hours

The goal is to provide insights into potential security threats and lay the foundation for a larger Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the future.

⸻

Objectives
	•	Design a MySQL database schema for managing large sets of logs
	•	Implement Python scripts to parse and insert logs into the database
	•	Run SQL-based anomaly detection queries
	•	Generate alerts for suspicious activity
	•	Demonstrate how log analysis supports both security monitoring and compliance frameworks (NIST, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
